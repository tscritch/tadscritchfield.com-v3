## [Invisible Cities]()

Putting this at the top of the list because it is my favorite even though I haven't finished it.
This book is a slow burner. It is comprised of tiny vingettes of describing fictional cities. It is intensly calming.
I have it on my bedside table to pick up if I need to settle my mind before bed.

## [Dune]()

## [Dune Messiah]()

## [The Creative Act: A Way Of Being]()

## [The Story of World War II]()

A fantastic overview of whole war. There's so much to cover about the war and this does a great job of hitting all the major events while diving down into personal stories to add color.

## [The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany]()

I have not quite finished this one (9hrs left of a 50+ hour audiobook) as it started to get into the attrocities the Nazi's inflicted on the their enemies. Was a bit hard to listen to.

## [Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36099654-vietnam)
